  <h1>Operations </h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Bid </b>
      <p>Bid or bargain is the reaction offer by a potential lender to a loan request. The <b>lender changes some parameters</b> of the loan request and sends to the borrower. The borrower now consider all the "bids" against his loan and chooses which suits him the best. The borrower is free to reject all the loan offers. </p>
      <p>Any user can make multiple "bids" against a loan request. This provides a free and flexible conversation between the parties. A rejection of a "bid" notifies the bid maker of the rejection and thus he/she can change his bid accordingly. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <b> EMI </b>
    <br>
      The borrower repays the debt in <b>small amounts paid periodically</b>. The EMI is calculated by the service. If the borrower fails to abide by the deadline, <b>penalty is imposed</b> which is proportional to the excess time taken.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b> Credibility (CRED) score </b>
      <br>
      <p>The "trust factor" of any user can be derived from his/her CRED score. This score is based on the previous history of tracnsaction by the user. A user who has paid his/her loans and EMIs on time will have more CRED score than other users. This ensures the security of investment by the lender.</p>
  </li>
  </ul>
    
<h1>Interaction and transaction are :</h1>
<ul>
  <li><b>Loan requests : </b></li>
    Each user can "request" for a loan. In this, he has to specify: 
    <ul>
      <li><b>Amount (INR) </b> he want to borrow.</li>
      <li><b>Interest rate (%) </b> he is expecting. </li>
      <li><b>Time (months) </b> for which he wants the loan. </li>
        </ul>
  After all this, other users can see his request in the <b>market</b> and then make a "bid" on the offer. 
  The charateristics of a loan request are:
  <ul>
    <li>The user can have <b>only one active loan request</b> at a time. </li>
    <li>There can be <b>multiple bids</b> against a loan request</li>
    <li>If the user agrees with the offer against his request, he can accept it and the loan processing would start. The request is removed from the market after this. </li>
    <li>Each <b>request has a lifetime of 20 days</b>. After this, the loan request is <b>removed</b> from the market.</li>
    <li>All of the loan requests by a user are <b>saved against his user id</b> in his all time transactions and are visible on his profile</li>
    <li>On the loan, if the user abides by the EMIs and the deadline, his <b>CRED score is  increased, else decreament</b> happen.
      
  </ul>
  </li>
  
<li>
  <b>Bidding</b>
  </li>
<p>
  The bidding on any loan request can be done using the <b>button provided on each card</b>. This ensure <b>ease of accessibility</b> for the bidder.
